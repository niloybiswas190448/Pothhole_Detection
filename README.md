## 🚀 One-Click Google Colab Demo

Run it in your browser (no setup needed):

- 📦 **YOLOv11 Detection + Segmentation Demo**  
  [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/YOUR_LINK_HERE)

---

## 📂 Project Repository

[GitHub Repo - Pothole Detection](https://github.com/yourusername/pothole-detection)

---

## 🔍 Overview

This project presents an automated solution for pothole detection and **segmentation** using the YOLOv11 architecture. It enables both **bounding box detection** and **pixel-level mask generation**, ensuring high accuracy and efficiency.

---

## 💡 Key Features

- 🛣️ Real-time pothole detection and shape segmentation  
- 🎯 Dual-output (bounding boxes + masks)  
- ⚡ 45 FPS inference on Tesla T4  
- 🧠 Built on YOLOv11 + custom segmentation head  
- 🗂️ Dataset of 700+ annotated road images  
- 📈 87.4% mAP@50 on validation set

---

## 📊 Model Performance

| Metric        | Bounding Box | Segmentation Mask |
|---------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Precision     | 0.882        | 0.874             |
| Recall        | 0.769        | 0.766             |
| mAP@50        | 0.875        | 0.870             |
| mAP@50–95     | 0.582        | 0.555             |

---

## 🧠 Model Architecture

- **Backbone**: YOLOv11 backbone (CSPDarknet with improved attention layers)  
- **Head**: Dual-head structure with detection and segmentation layers  
- **Loss Function**: Combination of Binary Cross-Entropy, Dice Loss, and IoU Loss

## 🧰 Run Locally

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pothole-detection.git
cd pothole-detection
````

### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

### ✅ What to Replace:
- Update your **Colab link**, **GitHub link**, and any image filenames (`result_detection.jpg`, `result_mask.jpg`, etc.).
- Add real sample outputs to your folder or repo and commit them (`demo.gif`, `dataset_samples.png`, etc.).

---

### 🔧 Bonus Tip:

To increase visibility:
- Add a **`pothole-detection`** GitHub topic tag.
- Pin the repo on your GitHub profile.
- Cross-link it on LinkedIn or portfolio site.

Would you like me to turn this into a **Colab notebook** next? Or help you make a **Streamlit demo app** for this?
