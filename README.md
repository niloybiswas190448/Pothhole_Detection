## 🚧 Overview

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and image processing to automatically detect potholes in road surfaces. It is designed to support smarter, faster infrastructure management for cities and municipalities.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Detect potholes in images using CNN  
- Enhance accuracy with preprocessing and edge detection  
- Localize defects and annotate outputs  
- Evaluate model with standard metrics

---

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Dataset**: Road surface images with/without potholes (JPG/PNG)  
2. **Preprocessing**: Resize, grayscale, edge detection, morphological ops  
3. **Model**: Custom CNN with Keras/TensorFlow  
4. **Postprocessing**: Contour detection and annotation  
5. **Output**: Potholes marked with bounding boxes or highlights
